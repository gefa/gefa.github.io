During the ISP (Independent Study Project) at WPI I have designed the quadrocopter schematic, laid out 2 layer PCB and solder all the components. Mentor for this project is prof. Richard Brown. The microcontroller on the board is MSP430F5529. Inertial measuring unit LSM9DS0 has 9 degrees of freedom, that is 3 axis accelerometer, 3 axis gyroscope and 3 axis magnetometer (compass). Kalman filter is still to be programmed.
