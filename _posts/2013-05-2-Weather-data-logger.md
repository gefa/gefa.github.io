Solar powered data logger was build by Alex Ryan, Ashton Kim, and Stefan Gvozdenovic during ECE design class. Data logger has sensors for temperature, humidity, pressure and light intensity sensor. Device uses solar panel to charge the Li-Po battery and can sustain itself as long as there is enough sunlight during the day. It collects atmospheric parameters and offloads them wirelessly.
