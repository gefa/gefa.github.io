PCB motor is based on piezo crystals soldered on a ring milled in printed circuit board. Traveling wave is created on the stator ring by superposition of sin(wt) and cos(wt) with varying amplitudes. Any object that stands on the ring will become rotor with angular velocity depending on the friction coefficient between the ring and the object.
