RoboLine is a private project from high school made on my own time. Robot's main task is to follow a black line. The microcontroller used was the AT89S8253. The light sensors that detect the black line are each composed of an IR (infrared) diode and a photo diode which are taken from an old optical mouse (single optical mouse contains 2 IR and 2 photo diodes which is enough for this project).
